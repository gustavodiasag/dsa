Implementations of a few trivial data structures and algorithms in order to explore some fundamental software engineering practices, such as modularity, readability, simplicity and consistency of code.

Given that the purpose of the project involves practicing those concepts, a considerably large number of operations are not focused on achieving the maximum performance for its category.
