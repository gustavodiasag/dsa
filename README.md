Implementations of a few data structures following Kyle Loudon's [Mastering Algorithms with C](https://everythingcomputerscience.com/books/Mastering-Algorithms-with-C-Loudon.pdf). The project is basically an exercise on modularity, readability, simplicity and consistency of code whithin a fictional library.

Considering that purpose, most implementations provided don't focus heavily on correctess or efficiency. The main goal is to define clear structuring of interfaces and apply as much data abstraction principles as possible.
