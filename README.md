Implementations of a few data structures and algorithms following Kyle Loudon's [Mastering Algorithms with C](https://everythingcomputerscience.com/books/Mastering-Algorithms-with-C-Loudon.pdf) aimed at practicing with some fundamental software engineering ideas, such as modularity, readability, simplicity and consistency of code.

Given that the purpose of the project involves practicing those concepts, a considerably large number of operations are not focused on achieving the maximum performance of its category.
