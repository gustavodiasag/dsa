Implementations of a few trivial data structures and algorithms aimed at working with some fundamental software engineering practices, such as modularity, readability, simplicity and consistency of code.

Given that the purpose of the project involves practicing those concepts, a considerably large number of operations are not focused on achieving the maximum performance of its category.
